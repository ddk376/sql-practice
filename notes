SQL joins
Suppose we have two tables Table A and Table B

Inner Join - produces only the set of record that match in both Table A and Table B
Full Outer Join - produces the set of all records in Table A and Table B, with matching records from both
                  sides where available. If there is no match, the missing side will contain null
Left Outer Join - produces a complete set of records from Table A, with the matching records (where available)
                  in Table B. If there is no match, the right side will contain null.
SELECT * FROM TableA
LEFT OUTER JOIN TableB
ON TableA.name = TableB.name

To exclude records we don't want from the right side via a where clause
SELECT * FROM TableA
LEFT OUTER JOIN TableB
ON TableA.name = TableB.name
WHERE TableB.id IS null

To exclude the records we don't want from both sides via a where clause
SELECT * FROM TableA
FULL OUTER JOIN TableB
ON TableA.name = TableB.name
WHERE TableA.id IS null
OR TableB.id IS null

Cross Join - Cartesian product
